## Inspiration 

Working as a teacher assistant at PS 130, the assistant principal introduced a basic website using Wix.com. After analyzing the design of the webpage, I believe an unique design, similiar to the design used by the Ivy league schools' website, could be added to this webpage. Using Columbia's, Princeton's, and Brown's website as inpiration, I created a single webpage to enhace the design used in wix.com.
