## Description

This is a one page web application project which contains an unique visual design compare to the website the school uses (ps130x.com). Users have access to the slideshow on the main page to choose the latest updates on the school. Abram Stevens Hewitt webpage shows academic subjects taught in the school, for exmaple, Phonics, Literacy, Math, Social Studies, and Science. There is a news section where users can read the latest news in the school. A calendar was added at the bottom of the page where users can see upcoming events. The calendar must be updated via html file. The application is responsive to desktop, tablet and mobile device.

## User Interface

### Homepage is divided into three sections: School updates, Academics, News, and Calendar.

- The carousel can be used to add collection of updates on the school's main events, or articles 
- The academic section contains 5 boxes where it can be potentially use for redirecting users to a separate page containing content related to the subject.



Webpage has header, main content, and footer.
I included a carousel and on the news section we have the selection option using JS.
Calendar section was created and hover effects were added on the nav  li.
